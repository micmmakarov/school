School
======

> School is a single place to organize information and interaction about classes transparently and accessibly to facilitate planning, scheduling, and sharing.

## Idea

The idea came out of our class @ Noisebridge to have an app helping organizing the class. 

## Main Features

### Attendance (RSVP)
Helps to see how many people visiting next class
### Classes announce 
We can post classes and subjects with descriptions, so our users can read it and RSVP. Also it sends e-mail notifications and tweets to our twitter account if we create a new class.
### Analytics
Get data about attendance and find what subjects are more interesting to people and what less
### Polls
Polls help to research users' opinion
/charts draws charts with the results
### Whiteboard
Generated for every lessons and synced real-time, so everybody can track our lessons
### Calendar
not only posts our events, but shows rails-related events in the city(using meetup API)
